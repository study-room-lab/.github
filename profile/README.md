# 👾 Study Room Lab

> A digital lab space for curious minds, learners, and builders from Bangladesh.

Welcome to **Study Room Lab** — a growing community of university students exploring the world of code, logic, and real-world problem solving.

We’re not fixed to one path — sometimes we're diving into **web development**, other times we’re buried in **algorithms, data structures (DSA)**, or getting our hands dirty with **cybersecurity** and **software development**. It all depends on where we are and where the future is leading us.
