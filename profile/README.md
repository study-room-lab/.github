# 🕶️ Study Room Lab

> 👾 Underground minds. Binary rebels. Powered by learning. Built for the future.

Welcome to **Study Room Lab** — an underground digital space for students who move like attackers, think like architects, and build like warriors.

We’re not just coders.  
We’re builders, breakers, dreamers, and deployers.  
A decentralized lab of students from Bangladesh rewriting the rules of learning.

## ⚡ Our Vibe: Cyber Vibe, Not Cybercrime

Yes — our energy feels like a **digital riot**.  
But we don’t break laws — we break limits.  
We’re students with fire in our cores, scripts in our heads, and chaos in our method.

We **simulate** attacks to understand defense.  
We build apps like fortresses.  
We explore AI like a mission, not a course.

## 🔥 What We Do

🧠 **AI & Machine Learning** — not theory, but action  
🦾 **Robotics & IoT** — connecting the physical and digital  
🌐 **Web & App Development** — fast, clean, experimental  
🔐 **Cybersecurity Principles** — ethical hacking, red vs. blue mindset  
📦 **Software Dev** — CLI tools, microservices, and weird scripts  
📊 **Data Structures & Algorithms** — because logic is power  
🎮 **Game Dev & Simulations** — sometimes just for fun

If it runs on code, lives in tech, or breaks your brain — we’re into it.

## 🧬 Who We Are

🇧🇩 Based in Bangladesh  
👨‍🎓 University-level students  
💥 Self-taught rebels, curious minds, logical misfits  
🕋 Many of us follow our faith — but we all follow curiosity  
💡 We believe in building, breaking, and bettering ourselves

> We are not an organization.  
> We are a **protocol of minds** — synced on one goal: **Level up. Together.**

## 🕸️ How We Work

- 🔍 Learn by doing. Learn by failing.
- 🧪 Collaborate in chaos, organize in code.
- 🧠 Share knowledge openly — no gatekeeping.
- 📁 Repositories for exploration, not perfection.
- 🤖 Bots, tools, APIs, servers — made for learning.

Some projects are solo. Some are squad-based. All are made with **grind and intention**.

## 🏴‍☠️ Think Like an Attacker. Build Like a Guardian.

This lab is a safe zone for dangerous minds.  
You’ll see folders that feel like exploits, but they teach defense.  
You’ll see code that looks like backdoors, but they open opportunity.

**We aren’t illegal. We’re unstoppable.**

## 🌱 If You’re One of Us

You're welcome if you:
- Run commands without fear
- Ask “what if I break it?”
- Learn faster under pressure
- Believe that failure is just a phase
- Want to build something real with real people
